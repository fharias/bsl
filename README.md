# SmartContract Architecture on Ethereum

In this repository you can always go to the [network](https://github.com/mesirendon/bsl/network "BSL Network view") in order to check how the project has changed between versions.

For the first step just create a new truffle empty project inside the working folder.

```bash
truffle init
```
