# SmartContract Architecture on Ethereum

## BSL Contract and its Testing

For this version the first test was implemented in order to check the basic behavior of the `BSL` contract.

The tests are executed lexicographically, so that's why tests will appear with a number.

To achieve this, you'll realize that there is a migration called `2_deploy_contracts.js` that will tell how contracts are deployed.
