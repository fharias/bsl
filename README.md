# SmartContract Architecture on Ethereum

## Conference Interface, BSL and SimpleConference Contract and their Testings

For this version I got a Conference Interface, a SimpleConference Contract implementation and their effects on the BSL Contract.

A little of my original design was changed during implementation.

## Dependencies

For this test I also included some new node dependencies:

```JSON
{
  "devDependencies": {
    "chai": "^4.2.0",
    "chai-as-promised": "^7.1.1"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "moment": "^2.22.2",
    "openzeppelin-solidity": "^1.12.0",
    "web3": "^1.0.0-beta.36"
  }
}
```
